# Todoist Helpers

Scripts for automating tedious things I do a lot with Todoist.

## Setup

To use with Fish, install [virtualfish](https://virtualfish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), then run the following commands:
```
vf new todoist
vf activate todoist
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
